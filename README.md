Computer Vision Projects

This repository contains a collection of computer vision projects implemented using Jupyter Notebooks. Each folder represents a distinct project that explores different techniques and architectures in the field of computer vision and deep learning.

Repository Structure

3D\_Volumetric\_rendering\_NERF

A project focused on 3D volumetric rendering using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to reconstruct and render 3D scenes from 2D images.

Class\_Activation\_Map

Code for generating Class Activation Maps (CAM) to visualize the regions in an image that are most influential for a given prediction. This helps in understanding model interpretability.

Image\_Caption\_Transformer

An image captioning project that leverages Transformer-based architectures to generate descriptive captions for images.

MRI\_scan\_classification

A project dedicated to classifying MRI scans, showcasing techniques in medical image analysis and diagnostic assistance.

OCR\_CTC

Implementation of an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system using Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss, designed to recognize text in images.

Spatial\_transformer\_network

Demonstrates the use of Spatial Transformer Networks to improve the spatial invariance of convolutional neural networks, thereby enhancing their robustness.

UNET

An implementation of the U-Net architecture, widely used for image segmentation tasks, particularly in the medical imaging domain.

UNET\_Attention

An extension of the U-Net architecture that incorporates attention mechanisms to better focus on relevant features during image segmentation.

Video\_clasifier\_conv3d

A project that employs a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for video classification, capturing both spatial and temporal features to classify video data effectively.
