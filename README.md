# Computer Vision Projects

This repository contains a collection of **Computer Vision Projects** implemented using **Jupyter Notebooks**. Each folder represents a distinct project that explores different techniques and architectures in the field of computer vision and deep learning.

## Repository Structure

### 1. **3D_Volumetric_Rendering_NERF**
A project focused on **3D volumetric rendering** using **Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)**. It reconstructs and renders 3D scenes from 2D images, showcasing the power of NeRF in visualizing complex 3D structures.

### 2. **Class_Activation_Map**
This project involves generating **Class Activation Maps (CAM)** to visualize the regions in an image that are most influential for a given prediction. It helps in improving **model interpretability** and provides insights into how the model makes decisions.

### 3. **Image_Caption_Transformer**
An image captioning project that leverages **Transformer-based architectures** to generate descriptive captions for images. This project demonstrates how transformers can be used to understand and describe visual content effectively.

### 4. **MRI_Scan_Classification**
A project dedicated to **classifying MRI scans**, focusing on techniques for **medical image analysis** and **diagnostic assistance**. This project showcases the potential of deep learning in the healthcare domain.

### 5. **OCR_CTC**
Implementation of an **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** system using **Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)** loss. It is designed to recognize text in images, making it useful for applications such as document scanning and text recognition.

### 6. **Spatial_Transformer_Network**
This project demonstrates the use of **Spatial Transformer Networks (STN)** to improve the spatial invariance of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. By adding spatial transformation capabilities, STNs enhance the robustness and flexibility of CNNs in processing images.

### 7. **UNET**
An implementation of the **U-Net architecture**, widely used for **image segmentation tasks**, especially in the **medical imaging domain**. This architecture is designed to perform pixel-wise segmentation with high accuracy.

### 8. **UNET_Attention**
An extension of the **U-Net architecture** that incorporates **attention mechanisms**. This modification allows the model to better focus on relevant features during image segmentation, improving performance on complex datasets.

### 9. **Video_Classifier_Conv3D**
A project that employs a **3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for **video classification**. By capturing both **spatial and temporal features**, this model can classify video data effectively, making it suitable for dynamic and time-varying visual content.
